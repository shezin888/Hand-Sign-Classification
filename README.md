# Hand Sign Recognition System

In this project we used Tensorflow model and OpenCV library in Python to detect the hand sign of the user and then predict the gesture of the hand sign meant by the user and display it on the screen

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required libraries.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
```bash
pip install OpenCV
```


## Usage
First we need to run get_img.py and capture images for dataset. After that use labelImg.py file to label the captured images manually. Then train seperated images to training and testing set and start the training part with the available images and start training. When the training is done start testing it with the test.py code. It open ups the webcam and start detecting the hand sign. Enjoyy!!

## Future Scope
It is really helpful for the mute people in the society to communicate to the rest of the world. We can integrate it with conference meeting apps like GMeet or Zoom, so that the mute people can easily convey their messages to others.

## Output
<img title="Hello" alt="hello" src="/hello.jpeg">
<img title="iloveyou" alt="iloveyou" src="/iloveyou.jpeg">
<img title="yes" alt="yes" src="/yes.jpeg">
<img title="no" alt="no" src="/no.jpeg">
